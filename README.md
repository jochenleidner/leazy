# Leazy

Leazy is a Turing-complete toy programming language created by Jochen L. Leidner as part of a high school thesis to explain compiler construction.
The name of the language is a contraction of "lazy" and "easy": lazy, because the language does not require variables to be declared before use (unlike C, which Leazy is compiled to) and "easy" as the language is designed to be extremely simple.
